# Dev log, bookie

## Day 1 (Jan 21)

Cried a lot, didn't make any progress at all. Struggled for hours.

## Day 2 (Jan 23)

Wiped everything and started a new repo, since the first day just induced anxiety. Today – I tried for hours, didn't get **anywhere**. Wanted to import a small set of book json mock data to populate the database – not to be used in the actual project – but just to populate the database with and get up and running. Struggled for hours because for some reason importing json files isn't supported? Even though IT'S BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES IN LECTURES PREVIOSLY? Anyhow – after lots of crying, struggling, and trying out with different starting projects, I finally found that using W19LiveSession1 as a starting point did the trick. Now I'm seeding the database, at least (still – something that's not technically even done for the project). Right now I feel I'm never gonna code after this course, tbh.

## Day 3 (Jan 24)

Things actually went... Ok? I managed to get up and running with the front-end AND back-end. Whoa. Honestly – starting with this project was hard. I managed to get along quite alright throughout the course, since it was a somewhat "snitslad bana", where you did one small thing after another for ~20 weeks, until you had done 20 things. But now, putting all 20 things together on your own?? Dude.

## Day 4 (Jan 25)

Progress, sweet progress. Google Books API went fairly smooth, and managed to piece together a search based off of the Happy Thoughts project. Realized that the "Author" field in my mongoose model is actually an array, though, so need to take care of that. Some day. For my own sake I *should* do it now, but I'm just gonna push it to a point when I really -have- to do it instead. Will it require more work at that point? Yes. But will I regret it? Most definitely.
